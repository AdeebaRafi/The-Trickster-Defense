# The-Trickster-Defense
A Simple Demo Against Model Theft: This is a small, educational project I built to understand the concept of Model Extraction Attacks and how to defend against them. The code demonstrates a "Trickster Defense" mechanism, inspired by the research paper "Training A Secure Model Against Data-Free Model Extraction".
